			Planning your reunion falls on your individual class. While you and
			your classmates will do the bulk of the work, we as the Alumni
			Association we would love to play a role in helping you make your
			reunion happen! </br> Typically, the reunion planning coordinating
			falls to whoever was your senior class president. However, this is
			not a strict rule and anyone from your class may take on this role.</br>
			If you are reading this, it probably means you are trying to figure
			out how to start! This guide is a basic step-through on the reunion
			planning process. Let's get planning!

			<h2>Step 1: Collecting your classmates</h2>

		<div class="row justify-content-center">
			<div class="blockD col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-5 col-xs-5 justify-content-center text-center">
				<h3 class="dtitle">Facebook</h3>
				<hr class="goldbar" width="75%">
				<p class="dInfo">This is our reccomended route if it is possible for
					your class. If you and your classmates are on Facebook, you will
					have a pretty easy time collecting your classmates! Even if you
					aren't Facebook friends with everyone, you know someone who knows
					someone else and so on.</p>
				<p class="dInfo">Create a Facebook group (not page) named "RHS Class
					of XXXX" and add everyone you are friends with. Allow
					non-moderators to add people via the group settings and make a post
					in the group about adding your other classmates. In less than a
					week you will have a huge portion of your class in one spot!</p>
			</div>
			<div class="blockD col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-5 col-xs-5 justify-content-center text-center">
				<h3 class="dtitle">Mailing Addresses</h3>
				<hr class="goldbar" width="75%">
				<p class="dInfo">Talking to your fellow classmates you are still in
					contact with, you will want to create a master list of the mailing
					addresses of as many of your classmates as possible. Utilize a
					phone tree and those old address books and collect the current
					information of your classmates.</p>
				<p class="dInfo">This is also the time to be hearing opinions from
					your classmates and finding out who would be interested in helping.
					Be sure to make note of all those who make any offers, you never
					know when you might need to cash in on one!</p>

				<hr class="goldbar" width="75%">
				<p class="dInfo">Now that you have everyone together in your
					Facebook group, see what everyone would like to do by create polls.
					When creating a post in the group, select "poll" from the post
					options. Remember, the more you ask, the easier the decision making
					will be for you.</p>
				<p class="dInfo">Suggestions on questions to gather: who can help
					take action, preferred time of the week (Friday evening, Sunday
					afternoon), location (St. Johns, Portland city limits), event type

				<h3 class="dtitle">Form a Committee</h3>
				<hr class="goldbar" width="75%">
				<p class="dInfo">Gather the people who were interested in helping
					when you collected everyone's information and form a planning
					committee. Your committee will make all of your decisions for the
					reunion. How you structure you committee is up to you, but in
					general you will want a committee chair, a secretary, and
					communications chair.</p>
				<p class="dInfo">Having a single communications chair ensures that
					communication is kept consistent, and having a secretary keeps
					everyone on the same page. All additional members should have very
					specific duties assigned by the committee chair.</p>

			<h3>Our notes:</h3>
			<p>If you are a class with a lot of young families, we suggest doing
				a picnic in the park. The event is family friendly and keeps to a
				very low budget.</p>
			<p>If your class is conflicted on a family friendly vs. adults only
				event, look into places that have a family friendly area and a bar,
				like a bowling alley or brewery.</p>
			<p>Before suggesting doing a dinner event for your reunion, be sure to
				research the upfront cost to the planning committee first. Talk it 
				over with your committee about the feasibility.</p>

					If your venue requires an organization to make booking requests,

					we can assist you. You can also check out our Grants page for
					information on our matching grants. </br> Looking for
					reccomendations on venues, services, and more? Many of our board

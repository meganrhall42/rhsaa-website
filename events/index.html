			        	In Celebration of the Centennial and as we look ahead towards Roosevelt's next 100 years, we are excited
			        	to give back to our beloved school and showcase our support of current students in need. 
				        <br><br>
				        We are collecting snack items to stock the student food pantry, and undergarments to contribute to the 
				        student clothing closet. All of these items are in high demand and will be incredibly helpful for these 
				        resource closets.
				        <br><br>
				        <b>Food Needed:</b> Juice boxes & Capri Sun, snack sized chip bags, granola bars, Pop-Tarts, dried fruit, canned meats.
				        <br><br>
				        <b>Clothing Needed:</b> Boxers, briefs, and panties of all sizes for teens/adults. Socks of all sizes, styles, and colors. 
				        All items must be brand new in packages or with tags. Bras are not needed at this time. 
				        <br><br>
				        The Centennial Committee will be on campus to collect donations the following days:

			        	<p class="col-12"><b>Tuesday, October 24th: 3:30 - 7:00pm.</b> Collection will be on the front lawn next to the driveway by 
			        	the Baseball field - look for the gold tents.</p>
			        	<p class="col-12"><b>Thursday, October 26th: 3:30 - 7:00pm</b> Same as Tuesday.</p>
			        </p>
				    <p>
						If you are interested in donating funds directly towards these student resources, cash or checks made out to the “Roosevelt 
						High School Alumni Association” can be dropped off at a collection day, or visit our 
							<a href="../donate/" title="Donate">Donate page</a> to donate online or mail 
						a check. We will collect all of the funds together to turn over in early November. 
						<br><br>
						We look forward to seeing our alumni community come together in support of students and can’t wait to see how big of an 
						impact we can make together.

			       		Recognizing our alumni who are veterans, especially those who gave the ultimate sacrifice, has been a priority for 
			       		the Alumni Association in recent years. It is appropriate to host an event in conjunction with our Centennial to remember 
			       		and honor those who have chosen this path in the past century.
			       		<br><br>
			        	We will host a short ceremony to remember those who gave the ultimate sacrifice as well as their families, and recognize
			        	the alumni who are currently serving or are veterans. Please join us as we pay our respects.
				        <br><br>
				        This ceremony will take place on campus at the Veterans Memorial Garden off Ida St. in front of the old auditorium
				        building. The Garden is very visible from anywhere in front of the school if anyone is unfamiliar with the space.
				        <br><br>
				        Due to the ceremony taking place on a Saturday we will not have access to the school building, including for restrooms.
				        Limited seating will be available for those in need. We have several tents in the event of rain, and if you are able to 
				        bring an umbrella please do so.
				        <br><br>
				        Our ceremony and remembrance time will last for about an hour total. We will have light refreshments.
						<br><br>
						Learn more about the Veterans Memorial Garden and how we have recognized those who made the ultimate sacrifice by visiting
						our Veterans page linked below.

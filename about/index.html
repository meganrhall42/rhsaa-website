					<li>The History Committee will complete the currently available display cases on campus by filling them with memorabilia, 
						information, and other decorations. The Committee will partner with the arts department and academic organizations to recognize 
						and display more accomplishments in those areas. The Committee will champion raising $1,000 to support these projects.
					</li>
					<li>We will support the Veterans Memorial Garden by organizing a clean-up of the space once per quarter. The Veterans Committee 
						will work with the Class of 1971 to complete a new bench that will be placed in the garden. The Committee will research how 
						to display the names of those killed in action and present a report to the Board detailing future work.
					</li>
					<li>We will recruit four new board members in order to expand the representation of our alumni base. We will focus on recruiting 
						at least one person from each of the following decades: 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, & 2010s. We will also create a new role for 
						student representative with defined duties that can be held by one or more students.
					</li>
					<li>We will formalize the All-Class Picnic Committee in order to better support the larger picnic events, and they will meet by 
						February 2024. The Committee will designate duties to members corresponding to aspects of the picnic such as food orders, 
						toilet and grill rental, etc. The Board at large will coordinate with the Picnic Committee to create a plan to table at the event 
						and recruit volunteers as well as promote the RHSAA.
					</li>
					<li>The Centennial Celebrations will continue through the end of 2023, hosting one event per month. Homecoming will be the 
						largest event of the year focusing on bringing in community members in addition to alumni and will include a free bbq 
						dinner. Through the sale of souvenirs and donations, the Centennial Committee will raise $2,000 that will be used to 
						place a commemoration of this celebration on campus.

				<h3 class="dtitle">5-Year Goals (2024)</h3>
				<hr width="75%" class="goldbar">
				<ul class="blockDInfo">
					<li>We will offer 5 students $1,000 scholarships (with the intention of aiming for higher if possible). </li>
					<li>Supporting students is a central theme to our organization. We will be donating $5,000 per year to student activities 
						through our grant program.</li>
					<li>One way we can engage more volunteers is to host specific days where alumni can plan and commit to single day activities. By 2024, 
						we will host quarterly "volunteer days" to complete RHSAA projects. The intent is that 4 days a year, we have large groups of people 
						come together and get a ton done in a short period of time!</li>
					<li>We often look back fondly on the clean up days that Southlake used to host and how they would come and beautify the grounds. 
						We want our landscaping committee to have implemented a landscaping plan to beautify the campus in a maintainable and 
						sustainable way. This would be an extremely visible display of our commitment to the school. </li>
					<li>We want to double the number of alumni participating at our existing events. This means over 150 people at our annual picnic and 
						over 500 alumni at homecoming, specifically. </li>

				<hr width="75%" class="goldbar">
				<ul class="blockDInfo">
					<li>We want to continue growing our organization with more active members in both volunteer positions as well as socially. 
						One day we would love to host monthly social events for alumni to connect with one another. </li>
					<li>Since the association began, we have been dedicated to helping students. In the future we want to have a large scholarship 
						fund that supports many students heading to college.</li>
					<li>Many of our commitments as the RHSAA also lie within the community, and we want to do more to help our neighborhood. 
						We want to invigorate North Portland through our students and alumni and strengthen Roosevelt's &amp; St. Johns' reputation through our work.</li>

				<h4>Communications Committee</h4>
				<p>
					To support connecting with our wider alumni base, we will recruit two additional volunteers to serve on the Communications Committee. 
					Over the course of the year the Committee will send at least 8 email newsletters to subscribers with updates and needs from the RHSAA. 
					The Committee will also establish a relationship with both the St. Johns Review and North Peninsula Review newspapers as the point of 
					contact for the RHSAA and submit Association updates.
				</p>
				<h4>History Committee</h4>
				<p>
					The Committee will partner with the arts department and academic organizations to recognize and display more accomplishments in 
					those areas. To preserve the basketball player mosaic in the gymnasium building, the Committee will install plexiglass to protect 
					this artwork, including pricing the cost of the project, raising the funds, and installing. To support adding new display cases to 
					the gymnasium lobby, the Committee will raise $7,000.
				</p>
				<h4>Veterans Committee</h4>
				<p>
					We will support the Veterans Memorial Garden by organizing a clean-up of the space once per quarter. The Committee will partner with 
					the PPS Bond office to ensure plans made for future campus expansion respect the Memorial Garden and that the RHSAA is included in 
					discussion.  A new memorial stone will be commissioned to honor those who gave the ultimate sacrifice by name.
				</p>
				<h4>Board Membership</h4>
				<p>
					We will recruit two new board members to recognize the 2000s forward. To increase visibility of our board members, we will purchase 
					a clothing item for each member to wear at events such as the picnic, homecoming, etc. We will create a roster of board members with 
					basic contact information and committee membership to be shared among board members. This will help us identify who is in charge of 
					what, how to contact them, and showcase where gaps in membership are.
				</p>
				<h4>Annual Golf Tournament</h4>
				<p>
					We will have two volunteers partner with the Annual Golf Tournament to begin learning the process for the event, and start the slow 
					multi-year transition to bring this event under the RHSAA. We will invite a representative from the Boosters to our organization to 
					ease this transition. We will establish a fundraiser to take place at the 2025 Golf Tournament.

				<hr width="75%" class="goldbar">
				<ul class="blockDInfo">
					<li>We will offer three $1,000 scholarships to graduating seniors to be awarded in June. The Scholarship 
						Committee will recruit two new voting members to participate in the selection and award process. The 
						Committee will champion raising an additional $1,000 for the scholarship fund to support this larger award.</li>
					<li>We will formalize the All-Class Picnic Committee in order to better support the larger picnic events. 
						The Committee will designate duties to members corresponding to aspects of the picnic. The Board at large 
						will coordinate with the Picnic Committee to create a plan to table at the event and recruit volunteers as 
						well as promote the RHSAA.</li>
					<li>We will create two competitions to fundraise a total of $5,000. We will host one in November and one in March. 
						These competitions will be run by the Board at large and will utilize social media and individual class spirit.</li>
					<li>We will create a 100th Anniversary Committee which will plan events to celebrate the centennial of the current RHS campus. 
						The Committee will meet by the beginning of October, and will plan events to be held in January 2023. There will be a 
						minimum of 5 members on this Committee.</li>
					<li>We will support our History Committee in their continued work towards preserving and displaying historical artifacts 
						on campus. The Committee will commission two new display cases, will complete the restoration of all athletic 
						and scholastic trophies, and will dispose of unwanted items in order to close out the current storage unit.</li>

				<h3 class="dtitle">5-Year Goals (2024)</h3>
				<hr width="75%" class="goldbar">
				<ul class="blockDInfo">
					<li>We will offer 5 students $1,000 scholarships (with the intention of aiming for higher if possible). </li>
					<li>Supporting students is a central theme to our organization. We will be donating $5,000 per year to student activities 
						through our grant program.</li>
					<li>One way we can engage more volunteers is to host specific days where alumni can plan and commit to single day activities. By 2024, 
						we will host quarterly "volunteer days" to complete RHSAA projects. The intent is that 4 days a year, we have large groups of people 
						come together and get a ton done in a short period of time!</li>
					<li>We often look back fondly on the clean up days that Southlake used to host and how they would come and beautify the grounds. 
						We want our landscaping committee to have implemented a landscaping plan to beautify the campus in a maintainable and 
						sustainable way. This would be an extremely visible display of our commitment to the school. </li>
					<li>We want to double the number of alumni participating at our existing events. This means over 150 people at our annual picnic and 
						over 500 alumni at homecoming, specifically. </li>

				<h3 class="dtitle">20-Year Goals (2040)</h3>
				<hr width="75%" class="goldbar">
				<ul class="blockDInfo">
					<li>We want to continue growing our organization with more active members in both volunteer positions as well as socially. 
						One day we would love to host monthly social events for alumni to connect with one another. </li>
					<li>Since the association began, we have been dedicated to helping students. In the future we want to have a large scholarship 
						fund that supports many students heading to college.</li>
					<li>Many of our commitments as the RHSAA also lie within the community, and we want to do more to help our neighborhood. 
						We want to invigorate North Portland through our students and alumni and strengthen Roosevelt's &amp; St. Johns' reputation through our work.</li>

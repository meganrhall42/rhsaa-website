				<ul class="blockDInfo">
					<li>The History Committee will meet with the RHS Principal to finalize a specific plan for location, 
						chosen artifacts, and appearance of on campus displays, then execute that plan. They will also find 
						a permanent storage location for the Association's historical artifacts, inventory and organize all 
						items, and create a plan for future digitization.</li>
					<li>We will create a 100th Anniversary Committee which will plan events for the 2022-2023 school year. 
						The Committee will be composed of at least one alumni per decade (from the 1950s-2020s), with members 
						from outside the Association welcome. This Committee will be in place by February 1st.</li>
					<li>We will create a Fundraising Committee with at least a Chairperson, who will create a plan and raise 
						$5,000.</li>
					<li>The Landscaping Committee will host two campus clean-up days (one in the fall and one in the spring) 
						to beautify the campus grounds, and will invite students, staff, and community members to participate 
						with alumni.</li>
					<li>We will recruit a Scholarship Committee Chair, and offer two $1,000 scholarships to graduating seniors 
						to be awarded in May. The Committee will meet by December 1st, whether a Chair has been established or 
						not.</li>

				<h3 class="dtitle">5-Year Goals (2024)</h3>
				<hr width="75%" class="goldbar">
				<ul class="blockDInfo">
					<li>We will offer 5 students $1,000 scholarships (with the intention of aiming for higher if possible). </li>
					<li>Supporting students is a central theme to our organization. We will be donating $5,000 per year to student activities 
						through our grant program.</li>
					<li>One way we can engage more volunteers is to host specific days where alumni can plan and commit to single day activities. By 2024, 
						we will host quarterly "volunteer days" to complete RHSAA projects. The intent is that 4 days a year, we have large groups of people 
						come together and get a ton done in a short period of time!</li>
					<li>We often look back fondly on the clean up days that Southlake used to host and how they would come and beautify the grounds. 
						We want our landscaping committee to have implemented a landscaping plan to beautify the campus in a maintainable and 
						sustainable way. This would be an extremely visible display of our commitment to the school. </li>
					<li>We want to double the number of alumni participating at our existing events. This means over 150 people at our annual picnic and 
						over 500 alumni at homecoming, specifically. </li>

				<hr width="75%" class="goldbar">
				<ul class="blockDInfo">
					<li>We want to continue growing our organization with more active members in both volunteer positions as well as socially. 
						One day we would love to host monthly social events for alumni to connect with one another. </li>
					<li>Since the association began, we have been dedicated to helping students. In the future we want to have a large scholarship 
						fund that supports many students heading to college.</li>
					<li>Many of our commitments as the RHSAA also lie within the community, and we want to do more to help our neighborhood. 
						We want to invigorate North Portland through our students and alumni and strengthen Roosevelt's &amp; St. Johns' reputation through our work.</li>

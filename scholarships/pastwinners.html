						<p class="card-subtitle"><br>Chloe was selected as one of the two Class of 2022 winners of our $1,000 college scholarship. 
						She will be attending Oregon State University in the fall and has an interest in wildlife sciences and similar subjects. 
						<br>
						One of the reasons her application stood out to us was because of her long standing volunteer commitment at the 
						Oregon Humane Society. She showcased her dedication to animals and her willingness to take on difficult tasks.
						<br>
						Chloe also had an incredible high school GPA and took 6 Advanced Placement courses. In addition to her volunteer work 
						she held a job and participated in multiple extracurricular activities. She even co-founded Roosevelt’s sign language club!
						<br>
						We are very excited to be able to offer Chloe some recognition, and wish her well in her future endeavors

						<img src="../images/scholarships/2022Denise.jpg"
							title="2022Denise" class="card-img queenPic" />
						<p class="card-subtitle"><br>Denise was selected as one of the two Class of 2022 winners of our $1,000 college scholarship. 
						She will be attending University of Portland in the fall and intends to study nursing. 
						<br>
						Her application was very moving for those of us on the committee, as she spoke about learning English as a second 
						language and her care for her parents and her family. Her biliteracy earned her high scores on Advanced Placement 
						exams in both English and Spanish!
						<br>
						She had an impressive high school GPA, and multiple extracurricular commitments, including being an outdoor school 
						leader and volunteering as a mentor at a local middle school.
						<br>
						We are very proud of all of the hard work Denise has put into her education, and wish her well in future endeavors.

			In recent years our fundraising efforts have been carried out by various board members as funding needs have arisen. We are looking to shift
			to a committee of dedicated volunteers who will focus primarily on those efforts and can learn and develop strategies most effective for
			our organization. Having members of this committee who can innovate and create plans for the future will help us achieve our funding goals.

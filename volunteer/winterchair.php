			Our summer all-class picnic was cancelled due to coronavirus, and are hoping to host an event later in winter to make up for the 
			lost social time. Alumni have expressed interest in a catered dinner, and dance and we have a group of volunteers excited to make this event happen. 
			The chair of this event will coordinate our volunteers and bring their ideas to life! (Perhaps this can become an annaul event too?)

						gave me the opportunity to start varsity basketball and baseball respectively as a freshman. Through all my schooling, my wonderful Mom and 
						family were a constant support and encouragement: thanks for being there, I love you. The honor of being inducted into Hall of Fame of the 
						best league in the State will live with me the rest of my life. It gives me great joy also to know I'm being inducted the same year with 
						my best friend of almost 40 years and counting, Mr Coach Robert Key. I Love you bro."

						<h5>Commentary:</h5>
						My love of all sports continues to this day. I give particular credit to my football coach Nate Jones, baseball coach Stan Bozich, and 
						basketball coach (and family friend) Maurice "Mo" Caba for my life-long skill and enjoyment of each of these sports. Coach Caba was a 
						Roosevelt athlete/alum, elementary teacher and retired Portland Public School administrator. He was my eighth grade baseball and basketball 
						coach and my first athletic role-model. I consider sports to be the first application of everything I learned in the classroom.
						</br></br>
						Thanks to all connected with the PIL, for the time, friendships, and memories the PIL gave me!

						<h5>Commentary:</h5>
						"My history teacher my junior year, Joe Courtney, told me to take something you love and make it a career. Well Joe, that's exactly what I did. 
						I became a US History teacher and football and basketball coach in the Oregon City school district for 30 years.
						</br>
						Two people have really made a huge impact on my life. The first is my wife Kathy. Having been a dedicated coach you really need a wife that 
						loves sports and also someone that can take the major role in raising our children since coaches spend so much time in the gym. Kathy did a 
						wonderful job with our three children Cassie, David and Bradley.
						</br>
						The other person is Brad Smith. Brad and I coached together for 25 years and he taught me so much especially how to be a strong Christian 
						coach with high character. We became like brothers and shared so many great moments together including nine state titles and three USA Today 
						National titles."

						<h5>Commentary:</h5>
						I first developed my love for sports at a very early age as I watched my older brothers Dick and Dale compete on the playing fields and courts. 
						A love I shared with my children Amanda and Kyle, who I coached at various levels of competition.
                        </br>
                        What I didn't realize at the time was that playing team sports would teach me many valuable lessons that I would apply in my personal and 
                        business life throughout the years.
                        </br>
                        I want to thank all the youth coaches that volunteered their time and the high school coaches that help develop my skills for athletics and 
                        life. A special thanks to Coach Dan Rom for encouragement and motivation, and knowing when to give me a kick in the butt when I needed it.
                        </br>
                        To all my teammates, thank you for the memories and the time and effort that you put in at the practices and in games. It was an honor and 
                        privilege and makes me very proud to call you teammates.
                        </br>
                        I would also like to thank my wife of 33 years, Toni. We met at Roosevelt. She would often attend games and cheer me and the team on. 
                        Thanks for your love and support throughout the years and for our beautiful family, which I love dearly. Sharing this honor with my family 
                        is even more special.

						<h5>Commentary:</h5>
						"Who inspired me? My oldest brother Byron, who is in the PIL Hall of Fame, was my mentor and my best roll model concerning sports. He always 
						let me hang around when he was participating in different sports. It helped that he was also a QB.
						</br>
                        Basketball coach Ralf Bergstrom and football assistant coach always took me to the side and talked to me about life and my future. They may 
                        think I was not listening, but I was. They taught me many things that turned out to help me later in life.
                        </br>
                        I could work after practice downtown at the Imperial Hotel because Mr. Bergstrom would drop me off every day after practice. We had many 
                        great conversations as he drove. Coach Nathan Jones would often take me out to dinner and other sporting events. We had many great talks 
                        as well. Also, head football coach Joe Gillis, who had faith in me, allowed me to participate and prepare the game plan as well as the 
                        strategy for each game. At game time he completely put me in control of running the offense allowing me to call my own plays. Even when he 
                        sent a play in and I didn't call it, he still didn't get mad at me. This allowed me to develop my leadership and group skills. I guess there 
                        is no surprise that I've always been a team leader and manager all my working career."

						<h5>Commentary:</h5>
						"I would like to thank everyone and everybody who has supported me throughout my life. Thank you for showing me love, positivity, believing in 
						me and walking this journey with me. Sports have always brought me happiness and a sense of direction, family, pride and an indescribable rush. 
						I enjoyed every week of practice, every game and the role I played for each sport.
                        </br>
                        I thank my grandma for raising me and putting up with me. Without her bigger than life heart and her always having my back, nothing in my life 
                        would have been the same, nor would I be the person I am today. I want to thank my coaches, friends, and the whole north Portland community 
                        for supporting RHS through the good and bad years. Special thanks to Geraldo Rivas and Zach Nold, my two brothers who always blocked for me, 
                        set a screen, or did the grunt work or supported me to get the recognition I got through the years. They did all this while never complaining 
                        or looking for attention. I am honored that I am one of the chosen few to be recognized for this accomplishment. I am very blessed and humbled 
                        to have gotten the opportunity and to do it for Roosevelt."

						<h5>Commentary:</h5>
						"The earliest athletic inspiration in my life came from Ken Thompson, a Director of The Columbia Boy's Club, reputed to be an ex-Minnesota 
						Viking. I was10 at the time and one of the youngest players in the league. We practiced on an old dirt field without goal posts. Before 
						practice he lined us up single file spread arm's length apart to look for glass, rocks, or anything that may puncture our skin while 
						practicing. He made us run around the field, it seemed for hours, before we started hitting drills. The field was so dry and hard our plastic 
						football cleats wouldn't make a dent in it. We absolutely hated it but not one of us was going to disappoint "The Man".
                        </br>
                        Ken pushed us like I had never been pushed before and we ended up taking the championship of the league two out of the four years that I 
                        played football before high school. We were able to honor Ken at a reunion that was held in his honor around 2012. Though he was close to 
                        90 years old, he was still that iron jawed man we all did not want to disappoint. Every man in that room knew that Ken Thompson loved him and 
                        had been an inspiration in our lives.
                        </br>
                        The most inspirational coach that I had in high school was Herb Harms. He was an Assistant Coach when I was a sophomore. In the early 70's not 
                        many, if any, underclassmen, made varsity. Our head coach at the time was Joe Gillis. Joe actually came up to me one day to let me know that 
                        I would more than likely be playing junior varsity. Sophomores didn't get to play varsity in 1971. It just gave me more incentive to work 
                        harder. With Coach Harms pushing me from behind and his many coaching sessions, Coach Gillis couldn't deny me a spot on varsity. Matter of 
                        fact, I was a starter at outside linebacker on opening day. Coach Harms became the varsity coach the next year as Joe Gillis had retired. 
                        Coach Harms was always there for us. After many years, we have lost touch with each other, but I will never forget him."

						<h5>Commentary:</h5>
						"Athletics have inspired my entire life. From a young age, I learned discipline, hard work, and team work while pursuing athletics. I was 
						always involved in some kind of sport growing up: swimming, canoeing, running, and football. It was a way of life for me and a positive 
						outlet for activity.
                        </br>
                        In school, I was always supported by my peers and coaches to strive to be my best. They led by example and friendship as we were a family 
                        who took care of each other. I have shared my love of sports with my own family, especially my son.
                        </br>
                        I look back on my high school years in athletics with fondness and gratitude because of the strength of our team, the family like relationship 
                        with my teammates and coaches, and the leadership skills I developed. This has resonated through my lifetime pursuits in education, career, 
                        hobbies, and family."

						<h5>Commentary:</h5>
						"I would like to thank Ed DeFreitas and the PIL Hall of Fame committee for selecting me to be a part of this exceptional group of volunteers, 
						community members, coaches and athletes. Throughout my career in athletics I have been fortunate to have won a few awards and achieve some 
						memorable accomplishments, but being inducted to the PIL Hall of Fame is at the top of the list. Thank you to my coaches and teammates, 
						without you, I wouldn't be in this position.
                        </br>
                        It's an honor to be inducted in the same class as two other north Portland natives as well. Jason Porter, one of the best student athletes 
                        to ever come out of North Portland and someone I have looked up to and have known for as long as I can remember. And Isaiah Johnson, who I 
                        never got a chance to see play, but has been described to me by numerous coaches as one of the best running backs they have ever seen play. 
                        Congratulations you two.
                        </br>
                        Whether it was sneaking in to Howard Hall in the middle of the night for some half-court basketball, or winning my first district 1 little 
                        league title with my friends, or playing one-on-one baseball at busy kids with Abino Vazques, or playing HORSE on a Nerf hoop at midnight in 
                        Casey Wecker's living room, I have always loved competing. It's a rush that can't be replaced. Once I got to Portsmouth middle school. I was 
                        consumed with sports, as were most of my closest friends.
                        </br>
                        During my four years at Roosevelt I got the opportunity to learn from, play with and compete against some of the best athletes in the state. 
                        Throughout my school years, I was mentored and taught by some of the best coaches and teachers in Portland Public Schools. Bob Olson, Jon 
                        Yoshiwara, Jeff Hollamon, Ralph Balducci, Roger Casciani, Jerry Campbell, and Jim MacDicken, thank you for your hard work and dedication. The 
                        life lessons I learned from all of you through sports; hard work, teamwork, preparation, and dedication are all things that have helped shape 
                        who I am today. To Mike Clopton, the man who can get more done in a day than most people can get done in a week thanks for getting me started 
                        in my coaching career, and for being a great mentor and friend.
                        </br>
                        If I could do my high school athletic career all over again, which is something most of us think about at some point in our life, I would 
                        change a few things, but attending Roosevelt isn't one of them. It was a special place, with special people, during a special time. I cherish 
                        the memories, and friendships that I made and the lessons that I learned. Beating a #1 ranked Madison squad in Baseball, and upsetting an 
                        undefeated Marshall football team and the look on coach Hollamon's face afterwards are things I'll never forget. I can still hear Coach 
                        MacDicken's pre-game speeches in my head like it was yesterday. Twenty-five years later I still get chills thinking about them.
                        </br>
                        To my parents, who have been the biggest influences on my life, and my biggest supporters, thanks for the example you set and the wonderful 
                        life you provided for Jennifer and I. To my wife Rachael, thank you for your support and patience while I try to give back through coaching. 
                        Tonight, I feel like one of the luckiest guys in the world. In the famous words of coach Mac, if you cut me open right now, I'd probably bleed 
                        black and gold! I'm proud to be a Roughrider and proud to be a member of the 2019 class PIL Hall of Fame!

						"Kenny honed his strength and coordination early with gymnastics through "circus kids" in the Portland City Parks. He remembers "good coaching" 
						at Roosevelt. Kenny coached Little League and Babe Ruth baseball teams for about 10 years. His son James followed his steps to Roosevelt 
						where he became an All-league quarterback in football and center-fielder in baseball. (From a brief phone interview.)
                        </br>
                        Kenny worked in a plywood mill and became a barber."

						<h5>Commentary:</h5>
						"My family has always been my greatest source of inspiration. As a child, both my older sister and my mother supported my athletic endeavors. 
						From my mother, I learned unconditional love. No matter how I played I knew I could look into the stands and see her encouraging smiling face 
						and that gave me the support I needed to always do my best and never to give up.
                        </br>
                        From my sister, I learned that practice makes perfect and if you give a 100% it will pay off down the road. My sister was one of my coaches 
                        for a few sports and she definitely pushed me to the next level by having high expectations for my performance.
                        </br>
                        Nowadays, as an adult, I see how positively my life has been shaped by sports. I now have the opportunity to share those experiences with my 
                        own two kids and the children I coach. I hope to show them that the teamwork and the relationships they make through playing are lessons that 
                        will benefit them all through the years. It's simply the best feeling to see these kids learn and the excitement on their face when they make 
                        an achievement like making a basket or winning a game.
                        </br>
                        I am extremely grateful to the friends, teammates, coaches, and family members that supported my sporting success over the years. I hope I 
                        live up to what they have taught me and I feel blessed to have the opportunity to share forward my learned life lessons of sports.
                        </br>
                        I have spent the last 5 years in a variety of rolls for the Portland Public School district and recently I accepted the position of Preschool 
                        Teacher at East Portland Community Center. Additionally, I have never stopped being a player/coach and this season I am focused on Volleyball, 
                        Basketball and Softball."

						room antics with my fellow teammates, Dave Johnson's (PIL Hall of Fame Inductee) musical jock strap his aunt made for him, playing a game at 
						the Memorial Coliseum against Jefferson High School, and my dad attending all may games.
                        </br>
                        This was a time when my coaches taught me about developing a strong worth ethic, to achieve my best on the basketball court, and in life. It 
                        was a time when I learned the power of being a team player and success it achieved. My dad always encouraged me to embrace coaching and learn 
                        from it.
                        </br>
                        I have used these principles throughout my working career to achieve success and have encourage my son Scott to do the same. (Scott earned All 
                        Conference and All State honors playing basketball and football for Central Catholic High School in 2007). Having the privilege of 
                        participating in PIL sports has had a huge impact on my life and I am thankful for that opportunity."

						<h5>Commentary:</h5>
						"Our brother was always very competitive throughout his childhood. In Little League Bob met his friend and mentor Don Tague who, along with 
						our mother, always gave him the support and encouragement that motivated him to achieve at baseball. He was an all-star in Pony League.
                        </br>
                        High school coaches Mason McCoy and Gene Desylvia had the acumen to see our brother's potential and motivated him to succeed through 
                        discipline, dedication, and hard work. All of these attributes helped to build his character and made him strive to be a high achiever.

						<h5>Commentary:</h5> (provided by partner Ruth Gregg on occasion of 2014 induction)
                        </br>
                        "As Sherron started her first year at Roosevelt she tried out for the girls tennis team because of the encouragement from the coach. As it 
                        turned out, she often mentioned that if it had not been for coach Fran Gannon, she could have easily dropped out, making bad choices in life.
                        </br>
                        Softball became her next love after tennis. Coach Gannon again had her try out for the Rose Buds junior softball team. She was moved up to 
                        the Erv Lind Women Softball team which won the the world championship in 1964. Again coaches had made the difference in her life. Lois 
                        Williams and Hap Piper (Erv Lind coaches) took her under their "wings" and with their guidance and discipline made the difference for 
                        Sherron. She always said if it had not been for coaches looking out for her she didn't know where she would have ended up in life."

						"I grew up playing sports from age eight through high school. It was so much more than just a game to me. It taught me how to win, how to

						continued to play golf for over 40 years with my coach Ralph Bergstrum. He was a great inspiration to me, as well as my parents who supported 
						me year after year."

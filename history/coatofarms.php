							<br /> Situated in the heart of Portland's St. Johns
							neighborhood, Roosevelt is deeply rooted in the culture and
							community of the area. The Roosevelt shield combines four
							different elements: <br />
							<br /> The spires of the iconic St. Johns bridge and the shape of
							the shield itself come from designs on foundational supports of
							the bridge; <br />
							<br /> The architecture of the Roosevelt clocktower with an "N"
							on top signifying Roosevelt as Portland's northern most high
							school; <br />
							<br /> The founding year of Roosevelt's predecessor, James John
							High School, 1906; <br />
							<br /> Two evergreen trees signifying the Pacific Northwest. <br />
							<br /> These elements are fused to create a strong graphic mark
							that brings pride to Roosevelt High School as well as the St.
							Johns community as a whole.

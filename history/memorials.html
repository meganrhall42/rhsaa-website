			The first three memorials were originally placed in the
			courtyard behind the main building, in a location of solitude and
			reflection, for students to give a moment of thought each time they
			passed on their way to class. When the campus remodel began in 2015,
			these memorials were stored and safeguarded so that they may be
			displayed again in the future. </br>
			</br> After the reconstruction completed, the RHSAA in conjunction
			with the current school administration decided on the location of the
			community garden as a final resting place for these memorials. In the
			coming years this garden will flourish with vegetation and other
			tokens of memory, and will remain a very central and public space on
			campus.

						This stone was placed in 2018 when the previous three memorials
						were moved to their new location. The intent behind this memorial
						was to honor a much larger group of veterans, including but not
						limited to: those who have served in any war such as those who
						served more recently, those who attended but did not graduate from
						Roosevelt, and the families who lost their children in these wars.
						</br>
						</br> This memorial was part of a large project by the Alumni
						Association with help from many other groups: The Blue Start and
						Gold Star Mothers, OM Memorial Company, and many of our local
						veterans organizations. A group of students also helped in this
						project, ensuring the stone was placed with care and stays well
						maintained.

						many students knew others serving, including their family members
						and classmates. This moved them to quickly decide that their class
						gift would be a memorial to remember those who bravely served.</p>

						Though the war ended a decade earlier, this stone was donated and
						dedicated in 1983 by the Girl's League. These ladies decided
						this was an appropriate action to take after learning that so many
						Roughriders had served in Vietnam and so many had lost their
						lives. They did not want these actions to be forgotten and created
						this project. </br>
						</br> The Girl's League was an ambassador program that started
						in 1943 for students to identify and address local issues that
						were important to the school and the neighborhood. It was through
						their research within the community that they discovered the
						necessity of this memorial.

					<p>
						Donated at the time of the Class of 1958's graduation, this was
						a very emotional project. WWII impacted the community heavily and
						many lives were lost from local families. The Korean War followed
						soon after the the pain was felt again. This class felt that it
						was their duty to memorialize these sacrifices and make a
						permanent fixture on campus, with this being the first veteran
						memorial placed. </br>
						</br> During WWII the student body population declined, as many
						young men withdrew from school to enlist in the military. Many of
						them did not return home. These young men would have been uncles
						and cousins to members of the Class of 1958.

			INTRODUCTION <br>
			The story of Roosevelt High School, begins much earlier than 1923. By the year 1906, the population of the St. Johns Community 
			had grown to over 2000, of whom 500 were elementary school children. Accordingly, the school board authorized the establishment
			of a high school. <br>
			The St. Johns High School began in September of 1906 in Room 1 of Central School, later called the Williams School. It was 
			located on Jersey Street between Charleston and John Avenues, where the present James John playground is located. The 
			attendance records have been lost, but the St. Johns Review reported 19 students present on opening day. <br>
			By September of 1907, the North School (now Sitton) was completed, and the high school students moved into the second floor
			quarters. The student body now numbered 75, and by the school year of 1909-1920, the faculty consisted of four regular
			teachers and three assistant teachers. <br>
			In 1910, the $40,000 James John High School was completed, and the students entered right after Thanksgiving vacation. Its
			location was at the north end of the present St. Johns Bridge, on a hill from which the students could see the ferry, as it
			plied its way back and forth across the Willamette. The building was made possible through the estate of James John, and a
			plaque honoring his memory was installed in the school. The first high school yearbook was published by the Class of 1911
			and called "The Golden." In 1916, the name was changed to "The Tumalum." <br>
			In 1915, St. Johns was annexed to the city of Portland, and school district #1 took over the operation of James John High.
			By 1922, the student body had grown to 480, and a new building was necessary. The main building on the new school was 
			erected in 1921, but it was not until January of 1923, that the students from James John entered. Theodore Roosevelt, 
			ex-roughrider and 26th president of the United States had died in 1919, and it was thought fitting to name the new school in 
			his honor -- Theodore Roosevelt High School.

			THE TWENTIES <br>
			On the night of January 25th, 1923, Roosevelt High School opened its doors officially for the first time. The occasion 
			was the graduation of the January 1923 class - 28 seniors from James John. Classes began on Monday, January 29th, 1923. 
			At least they tried to begin. A fuse blew and the power went off, and all the students went home. They tried again on
			Tuesday. Mr. W.T. Fletcher came over from James John as Roosevelt's first principal. Mr. Charles A. Fry became principal
			in 1924. The "Tumalum" became "The Ranger." <br>
			In the spring of 1923, Roosevelt High School received a great honor. Under the rules of the Rose Festival at that time,
			a princess was selected from each of the city's seven high schools. The queen was selected by the public -- it cost a 
			penny to cast a vote. The St. Johns community rallied 'round, and Roosevelt Senior Lucy Lee Thomas became Queen Lucy Lee I.
			This was not to happen again for 42 years. <br>
			In 1925, students had a choice os belonging to the Melpalians (a drama club), Social Service (the ancestor of the Teddyettes),
			the Latin Club, the Fire Drill Squad, The Radio Club, and Tri-Y, and Hi-Y. <br>
			By 1929, there was a student Council, a Girls League, a Literary Club, the Spanish Classes were publishing a paper (bi-weekly),
			and oh yes, the Latin Club.

			THE THIRTIES <br>
			In 1931, the East wing was added to the building. Then the wing contained the Auditorium, the Cafeteria, and the Music Room. 
			Today it houses the Auditorium, ISC, and Drama Room. In 1939, the portables were constructed. There were 5 originally (we still
			have 4). $30,000 had been spent on a track in 1923; this was rebuilt in 1939 to include a baseball diamond, a football field, and 
			a tennis court. <br>
			Mr. Charles Fry left Roosevelt in 1938, and Mr. Colton Meek became principal. <br>
			Roosevelt's first State Championship was brought home by the 1935 track team, coached by Mr. Harold York. Mr. Arthur Larsell's
			baseball team won the City Championships in 1933. <br>
			The thirties saw the beginning of a regular bi-weekly school newspaper. The "Mikerophone," came into existence in the spring of 1931.<br>
			In 1930, the present method of selecting the Rose Festival Court was established, and the following girls carried the banner for 
			Roosevelt during this decade: <br>
			ROSE FESTIVAL PRINCESSES OF THE THIRTIES <br>
			1930 - Reba Moore <br>

			STATE CHAMPIONS - 1949
			</br>
			THE FORTIES <br>
			The early Forties brough a beautiful addition to Roosevelt -- back before the war, when the Portland Airport was on Swan Island, people
			would drive down to see the Japanese cherry trees in bloom. The trees were not moved to the new airport site. In fact, the city's plan
			was to bulldoze them to make room for the shipyards. Through the intervention of Lee Baker of the Administration Building, in 1943 six
			of the trees were brought to Roosevelt and planted under the direction of Mr. John  Griffith, who had become principal that year. For 
			thirty years now students, teachers, and neighbors have enjoyed the beauty of the trees each spring. When the cherries are in bloom,
			Roosevelt is one of the loveliest sights in Portland. <br>
			In 1946, Mr. Harold York became principal, and the "Mikerophone" became the "Ranger Weekly." <br>
			May 30th, 1948....the breaking of the dike -- the rushing of the water -- and within minutes, thousands of people were homeless.
			Roosevelt offered shelter to some of the evacuees -- and families moved into the portable. In fact, one family contracted the measles
			there and a portable had to be fumigated. <br>
			Athletics picked up a bit during the Forties. In 1941, Roosevelt won the city basketball title for the first time and shared the title
			with Grant in 1942. The school year of 1944-1945 brought the first football title. <br>
			In this, Roosevelt's Golden Anniversary year, it seems only fitting to pay tribute to our Golden year of athletics -- the 1948-1949 season.
			First, Mike De Lotto's football team finished in a first-place tie with Jefferson, but lost the play-off game. During basketball season,
			the tables were turned -- again -- the team tied with Jefferson for top honors, but this time they won the play-off and went on to 
			become State Champions. The baseball team didn't have to share its title with anyone, they too became State Champs! Both teams were coached
			by Rollie Rourke. <br>

			THE FIFTIES <br>
			The Fifties opened with a continuation of the athletic prowess shown in the late Forties. The 1950 Basketball team won the city title. The 
			baseball team kept its state title. In 1951, the football team shared the honors with Grant. It was another city basketball title in 1954.
			That was the year when Earl Younce's baseball team finished as runner-up to Grant, but went on to win top place in the state. <br>
			The gymnasium was opened in 1953. In 1959, the state of Oregon was 100 years old, and preparartions were made to celebrate it. A contest was
			announced for amateur song-writers, to write the official Centennial song. When winners were announced, it was found that all three attended
			Roosevelt. <br>
			If you are old enough to remember Uncle Nate and "Stars of Tomorrow," you undoubtedly remember the Whippoorwills, who sang the theme song for
			several years. These were the girls who wrote the Centennial song: Janet Campbell, Joan Neifert, and Georgann Roberts of Roosevelt. <br>
			Governor Mark Hatfield and May Terry Schrunk attended the ceremonies at Roosevelt, at which the Whippoorwills were presented their award. <br>

			THE SIXTIES <br>
			By the decade of the 1960's a rare form of Rose Festival paranoia had set in among the people of St Johns. Since 1930 Roosevelt had sent
			a succession of lovely girls to the Queen competition and had never won. The student body, undaunted, always sent the largest rooting 
			section of any school in Portland. then, on a June night in 1965, the announcement was made -- "Queen Sally I, of Roosevelt!" The 
			subsequent roar almost shattered the glass walls of the Coliseum. On the day of Sally's triumphant return to school, the football field
			was packed with students, alumni, press and faculty. The field arose, turned around three times in the air; the cheering was heard all
			over St. Johns! It was indeed a day to remember. Then, as if to show that Roosevelt had found the formula at last, barely six years later
			in 1971, Kristi Lee became Rose Festival Queen. <br>
			The Sixties also saw some new additions to the building. The Library Wing was opened in 1960, and in 1965, through the efforts of Mrs. 
			Lois Sayles, Roosevelt recieved the Knapp Grant, which further upgraded the facilities. <br>
			In 1966, the old cafeteria (also know as the Black Hole of Calcutta) was converted into a resource center and the teachers' dinning room
			into a television studio. And what provisions were made for an eating place? The beautiful complex was opened in September. The new 
			cafeteria was bright and airy -- the patio outside was a pleasant place to sit on a sunny day. <br>
			The school newspaper acquired a new name.... the "Ranger Weekly" became "The Roughrider" in February of 1964.<br>
			On the athletic front, baseball was the sport of the decade. Stan Bozich's 1966 team was City Co-champion with #3 in the state, and North
			Division Champion in 1971. <br>
			In 1960, Mr. Harold York was transferred to Washington, after fourteen years here. Mr. Don James took over, the youngest principal in the
			city; he left in 1968 to become supervisior of Area II. He was replaced by Mr. Arthur Westcott. <br>

			THE SEVENTIES <br>
			In 1970 Roosevelt received a new principal, Mr. David Wienecke. The School began gradually to acquire a new look and a new feeling. Graduates
			of even a few years ago would find things very differnet today. It's not only the long hair on the boys, the blue jeans on the girls or women
			teachers in pant suits. The English and Physical Education Departments have instituted elective courses from sophomore year on, and the first
			year science students are taking 9-week "mini" courses of their own choosing. The time are changing, and Roosevelt is changing too. Look in on
			the new shops sometime, or the house the Building Construction cluster has build on N. Jersey Street. Many students are working part time for
			school credit. <br>
			The cherry trees are thirty years old now and showing their age. The Girls League has made it a continuing project to replace them -- two little
			ones have been planted since 1970. <br>
			1971 brought us our second Rose Festival Queen, Kristi I. And in 1972, Roosevelt became the second high school in Portland to elect two sets of 
			sisters as Rose Princesses. They were Frances and Elizabeth Chaney, 1939 and 1941, and Gail and Becky Gieschen, 1966 and 1972.

			Roosevelt's history has been one of growth and readjustment to meet the needs of its community. From its beginning in 1906, the school has
			occupied three different school sites, moving to its present location in 1923. A new cafeteria-classroom unit and independent study center
			was added to the school in 1965, and a new career education wing with a woodship and metal clusters program was dedicated in the fall of 1971.
			Roosevelt's 1,552 students have the benefit of an excellent school library, with close to 30,000 volumes. The library was developed over a 
			three-year period with a special grant to establish a model high school instructional materials center. Roosevelt has strong business-education
			programs, office practice experience for senior girls, coeducational automotive shop, exemplary metals cluster program and special centers for
			remedial and developmental reading.

			To our Present Students <br>
			I hope you read this book. Maybe there are some things in it that you don't know. I know it isn't the thing nowadays to admit that there is such
			a thing as school spirit. But look around you -- the spirit of Roosevelt is here. It's the memories people carry -- the first time the kids came 
			in from James John -- the first city athletic title -- the first state title (and we've had a few) -- the first Rose Festival Queen -- and the
			thousands of people who've gone to school here in 50 years. It's the tremendous response we've had to the Anniversary Celebration. I don't know
			of another school in Portland that could get the response that we have. <br>
			Maybe you won't really understand what I'm trying to say until about ten years after you graduate -- but if you do, please let me know.

		<div class="row generalText col-lg-10 col-md-10 col-sm-12 col-12"> 
			To the Alumni <br>
			About three years ago when we first conceived the idea of celebrating our Golden Anniversary, we never expected it to grow as large as it did.<br>
			You have worked long and hard, and shown a love for this school that present day students should look upon with awe. <br>
			I consider it an honor to teach in such a school. I consider it an honor and a privilege to have work with you on this celebration.<br>
			I hope you enjoy this book. It is my gift to you. 
		</div>
		<div class="row generalText col-lg-10 col-md-10 col-sm-12 col-12"> 
			Afterward <br>
			We're sorry that the Theodore Roosevelt Statue couldn't have been installed for the Anniversary Celebration. Its acquisition is the culmination
			of a lot of hard work by many people, mainly Jim Chrest who headed the committee. <br>
			Our wish for the next Fifty years is that Roosevelt remains a school to be proud of -- one that her graduates will remember with love. <br>
			SEE YOU IN 2023!
